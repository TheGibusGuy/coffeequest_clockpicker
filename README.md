# coffeequest Clockpicker

Made for coffeequest, a cool game by fileto: https://fileto.itch.io/coffeequest

Requires AutoHotkey to work, run with Ctrl+Q.

You'll have to manually stop it with your taskbar since I didn't program it to be able to stop halfway through. Be sure to not have any text documents open.

Open the puzzle, then run the hotkey.
